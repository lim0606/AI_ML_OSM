Bayesian k-means algorithm


--Requirements
This program runs on Matlab.


--Hot to Use
1. run Matlab.
2. cd where you un-archived the source.
3. run bkm_sm or bkm_bu.
   bkm_sm and bkm_bu are respectively top-down and bottom-up Bayesian
   k-means algorithm.
   e.g.   
   >> bkm_sm(DATA)
   >> bkm_bu(DATA)
   DATA is a DxN array where D is the dimension and N is the #datapoints.

   You can also run them with an option 0 like
   >> bkm_sm(DATA,0)
   >> bkm_bu(DATA,0)
   In this case, bkm_sm and bkm_bu do not use either KD-Trees or
   Conga-Lines.
